#Video compressor tool made with WPF and ffmpeg

---

## Todos
- ### Bugs
  - Disable compress button, when "ask later" for target size is enabled 

- ### Settings
  - #### Inside settings:
    - Select how many threads should work concurrently for the actual compression
  - #### Inside preset-settings:
    - if "target size" is selected, make a "before compression" question out of it
- ### Progress bar
  - Progress of actual compressions shouldn't work, when changing "currentlySelected..."
    - Check it and fix it potentially
  - Progressbar's width should stretch under the thumbnail
- ### Video playback slider
  -  ctrl + scroll "scroll" deeper in the timestep
  -  scroll to offset timestep to left or right
